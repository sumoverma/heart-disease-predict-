# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical and lifestyle factors. It leverages structured datasets, feature engineering, and predictive models to provide accurate risk assessments.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts for better insights.
- **Deployment**: Flask/Django-based web application for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes patient information such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits. Data is sourced from reputable medical databases.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.8)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask/Django (for deployment)

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Load dataset and preprocess data.
3. Train the model using `train.py`.
4. Test and evaluate performance.
5. Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
